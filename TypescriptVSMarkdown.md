Features of TypeScript:

    TypeScript Code is converted into Plain JavaScript Code: TypeScript code canâ€™t be natively interpreted by browsers. So if the code was written in TypeScript, it gets compiled and converted into JavaScript. This process is known as Trans-piled. With the help of JavaScript code, browsers are able to read the code and display it.
    JavaScript is TypeScript: Whatever code is written in JavaScript can be converted to TypeScript by changing the extension from .js to .ts.
    Use TypeScript anywhere: TypeScript can be compiled to run on any browser, device, or operating system. TypeScript is not specific to any single environment.
    TypeScript supports JS libraries: With TypeScript, developers can use already existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, or call the TS Code from native JavaScript code.

Difference between TypeScript and JavaScript:

    TypeScript is known as an Object-oriented programming language whereas JavaScript is a prototype based language.
    TypeScript has a feature known as Static typing but JavaScript does not support this feature.
    TypeScript supports Interfaces but JavaScript does not.

Advantages of using TypeScript over JavaScript:

    TypeScript always points out the compilation errors at the time of development (pre-compilation). Because of this getting runtime errors is less likely, whereas JavaScript is an interpreted language.
    TypeScript supports static/strong typing. This means that type correctness can be checked at compile time. This feature is not available in JavaScript.
    TypeScript is nothing but JavaScript and some additional features i.e. ES6 features. It may not be supported in your target browser but the TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3, ES4, and ES5 also.

Disadvantages of using TypeScript over JavaScript:

    Generally, TypeScript takes time to compile the code.

JavaScript is best known for web page development but it is also used in a variety of non-browser environments. You can learn JavaScript from the ground up by following this JavaScript Tutorial and JavaScript Examples.
